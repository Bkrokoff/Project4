  Brett Krokoff: Scrum was beneficial to me because it allowed me to keep better track of my progress. 
  Instead of not knowing how far we were making it or if parts of the prject were taking longer than others we were easily able to schedule around it. 
  I will use scrum towards almost all project approaches I have in the future because it helps me to keep track of progress.
